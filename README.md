<h1> 📌 Project Description </h1>
Lifesaver is an emergency assistance web application designed to provide immediate medical guidance based on user-submitted symptoms and emergency needs. The system helps bridge the gap between an emergency event and professional medical assistance by:
<br>
✅ Collecting essential details such as name, contact, age, location, symptoms, and whether an ambulance or police assistance is required.<br>
✅ Using OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to provide instant medical advice based on the user’s symptoms and emergency situation.<br>
✅ Storing submitted data securely in a MySQL database for future reference.<br>
✅ Redirecting users to a confirmation page with an option to receive assistance.<br>

This project is particularly useful in time-sensitive medical emergencies, helping individuals receive first-aid instructions while waiting for professional help.<br>
